# CSV-Parser
Here's the modified text with spaces retained for readability:

"Simple ETL project in CLI that inserts data from a CSV into a single, flat table.

Result of execution (Console log):
Starting extracting data...
Data extracted successfully! - 30,000 rows
Starting filtering data...
Found duplicated data! - 221 records
Saving duplicates into output.csv...
File saved successfully.
Data inserted successfully - 29,779 rows

The tasks that you have outlined are completed by this program. But for effective data processing in C#, it's best to use multithreading when working with large amounts of data. Column indexes are also useful to further optimize efficiency with large datasets."
